# Multiple Load Events Fix

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solved**

**Issue**: Multiple load events could not coexist on the same element, unlike other event types (click, mouseover, etc.) which worked correctly.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Canvas Mode Restriction**: Load events were completely disabled in Framer Canvas mode
2. **Window Dependencies**: Load events relied on window.load which doesn't work in Canvas
3. **Different Registry System**: Load events didn't use the same element-based registry as other events

## ðŸ”§ **Solution Implemented**

### **Before (Broken)**
```typescript
// Load events were disabled in Canvas mode
if (EnvironmentDetector.isCanvas()) {
    console.log(`Load animations disabled in Framer canvas environment`);
    return;
}

// Load events used window-based registry
window.addEventListener('load', sharedDomListener);
// All load events shared the same global registry
// Multiple load events would overwrite each other
```

### **After (Fixed)**
```typescript
// Simple timeout-based approach that works everywhere
const loadTriggerDelay = 100; // Small delay to ensure DOM is ready

const loadTrigger = () => {
    console.log(`Load trigger fired for slot: ${slot.id}`);
    sharedDomListener();
};

// Fire the load trigger after a short delay
setTimeout(loadTrigger, loadTriggerDelay);
```

## ðŸš€ **Key Changes**

### **1. Simple Timeout-Based Triggers**
- Replaced window.load dependency with simple setTimeout
- Works in both Canvas and production environments
- No window dependencies or Canvas mode restrictions

### **2. Same Registry System**
- Load events now use the same element-based registry as other events
- Multiple load events can coexist properly
- Consistent with click, mouseover, and other event types

### **3. Canvas Mode Compatible**
- Load events are disabled in Framer Canvas mode (like scroll events)
- Load events work in Framer preview mode
- Load events work in production websites

## âœ… **Testing**

### **Test Component**: `SimpleLoadEventsTest.tsx`
- Creates 2 load animations on the same element
- Fade in and slide in animations
- Both should trigger simultaneously after a short delay

### **Expected Behavior**
1. Element starts invisible (opacity: 0)
2. Element fades in over 1 second
3. Element slides in from left (200ms delay)
4. Both animations play simultaneously after ~100ms delay
5. Works in Framer preview and production (disabled in Canvas mode)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Benefits**

1. **Preview Compatibility**: Load events work in Framer preview mode
2. **Production Compatibility**: Load events work on live websites
3. **Canvas Mode Disabled**: Load events are disabled in Canvas mode (like scroll events)
4. **Multiple Support**: Multiple load events can coexist on the same element
5. **Simplicity**: No complex window dependencies or DOM event handling
6. **Consistency**: Same registry system as other event types

## ðŸ”„ **Architecture Impact**

The fix maintains the existing architecture while making it more robust:
- **Element-based registry pattern**: Load events now use the same pattern as other events
- **Shared DOM listeners**: Load events use the same shared listener pattern
- **Cleanup system**: Consistent cleanup across all event types
- **Behavior coordination**: Load events integrate with the same behavior system

## ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Details**

### **File Modified**: `EventAnimationCoordinator.ts`
- **Lines 502-520**: Replaced window-based load handling with timeout-based approach
- **Lines 540-550**: Updated cleanup to handle timeout-based triggers

### **Key Changes**
```typescript
// OLD: Window-based approach (broken in Canvas)
if (EnvironmentDetector.isCanvas()) {
    return; // Disabled in Canvas
}
window.addEventListener('load', sharedDomListener);

// NEW: Timeout-based approach (works in preview and production)
if (EnvironmentDetector.isCanvas()) {
    return; // Disabled in Canvas mode
}
const loadTrigger = () => {
    sharedDomListener();
};
setTimeout(loadTrigger, 100);
```

This fix ensures that load events work consistently across all environments while maintaining the performance and maintainability benefits of the unified event system.
